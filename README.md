# worklog
Simple python script that displays the total number of hours worked in a week.  
Must be provided a .txt file in the following format:

IN <timestamp>
OUT <timestamp>
IN <timestamp>
OUT <timestamp>

I am using the android app Tasker to create the timestamp file by appending either an "IN" or an "OUT" 
line triggered by entering or leaving a geographical area.  

Requires python for android.
